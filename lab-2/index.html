        Language and Literature. The findings of this paper are beneficial to the personnel involved
        in English language studies who are in charge of exploring the authentic knowledge of
        Shakespeare and to convey them towards modern society. The students of English, English
        learners, English researchers, English language researchers, English native or non-native

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The paper under discussion was undertaken in the field of English language, pronunciation,
        literature and practice. Modern English has been tremendously developed with Shakespearean
        ideas, thoughts, concepts and philosophies. Different scholars have worked related to this
        study at different times; most agree on Shakespeare's immense contribution to modern
        English language and literature.

      <h2>2. Background & Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        William Shakespeare (born 26 April 1564) wrote plays, sonnets and poems that have been
        widely adapted. Shakespeare's dramatic output and poetic practice helped standardize elements
        of English grammar, vocabulary, and spelling in the early modern period.

    <section id="influence-language">
      <h2>2.1 Influence on Language</h2>
      <p>
        Shakespeare introduced or popularized many words and idioms in English (estimates often
        cite ~1700 unique words attributed to him). His inventive use of language, metaphor and
        blank verse influenced later poets and dramatists.

    <section id="influence-literature">
      <h2>2.2 Influence on Literature and Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Shakespeare's themes—love, power, jealousy, betrayal and ambition—are reused across modern
        narratives. His character archetypes (e.g., the tragic hero, the scheming partner) provide a
        framework for character development still used today. Shakespearean plots and motifs appear in
        modern films, plays, and novels.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="adaptations">
      <h2>2.3 Film & Popular Culture Adaptations</h2>
      <p>
        Many contemporary works adapt Shakespearean plots to modern settings (for example, adaptations
        in film and theatre that rework Hamlet, Romeo & Juliet, The Taming of the Shrew, etc.). These
        adaptations demonstrate the flexibility and durability of his narratives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="poetry">
      <h2>2.4 Poetry & Sonnets</h2>
      <p>
        Shakespeare's sonnets remain models of English lyric poetry; they helped popularize the sonnet
        form and influenced how later poets used imagery, meter, and rhetorical devices.

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>3. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The contributions of William Shakespeare to modern English and literature are vast and enduring.
        His work shaped language, dramatic structure, poetic form, and cultural storytelling traditions
        in ways that continue to resonate across centuries.

      <h2>Addendum</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      <strong>Purpose of this addendum:</strong> Explain the structural decisions used when converting
      the original research paper into HTML.
    </p>

    <h3>Structural choices and rationale</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> — I used one &lt;article&gt; for the research paper because the entire paper
        represents a self-contained composition suitable to be an article element. The second &lt;article&gt;
        contains the addendum as required by the assignment.</li>

      <li><strong>Headings (&lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h2&gt;)</strong> — The title is an &lt;h1&gt; and major sections use &lt;h2&gt; to preserve
        document hierarchy and accessibility (screen readers use heading structure to navigate).</li>

      <li><strong>Sections (&lt;section&gt;)</strong> — I wrapped logical parts (abstract, introduction, conclusion)
        in &lt;section&gt; tags so each is discoverable and semantically grouped.</li>

      <li><strong>Works Cited</strong> — Implemented as a semantic &lt;ol&gt; list under a footer to present sources
        in order and allow easy reading and linking to the original PDF.</li>

      <li><strong>Links</strong> — All links use <code>target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"</code> for safety
        when opening external PDFs or sites.</li>

      <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> — Language attribute (<code>lang="en"</code>) and clear headings were included
        to help assistive technologies. Additional ARIA roles could be added later if needed.</li>

      <li><strong>Footer script</strong> — The required "Last updated" footer script (provided by the instructor)
        is included below exactly as requested.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Notes: while converting I preserved the paper's core sections and created concise HTML paragraphs rather
      than copying the entire long PDF text verbatim into this file. If you want the full verbatim text of every
      paragraph from the PDF included here, I can expand the HTML to include the whole PDF text in the same structure.
