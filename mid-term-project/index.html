    <h2>Project Addendum – Pokémon Adventure: Choose Your Own Journey</h2>
    <p><strong>Planning and Concept:</strong>  
    The story follows a Pokémon-style adventure where the player starts with one of three starter Pokémon: Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur. Each choice creates a branching storyline with unique adventures and endings. A flowchart was drawn first to plan the paths and ensure all 8 endings were reachable.</p>

    <p><strong>HTML Design:</strong>  
    The HTML structure contains a title header, story container, choice buttons, and an image section. The “last modified” footer is embedded per project requirements. This structure supports DOM updates via JavaScript.</p>

    <p><strong>CSS Styling:</strong>  
    The CSS uses Pokémon-inspired colors—red, blue, and green—depending on the starter theme. Buttons have hover effects and rounded corners for a game-like aesthetic. The layout remains responsive and centered for readability.</p>

    <p><strong>JavaScript Functionality:</strong>  
    Each story node is defined as an object containing text, choices, and an image. The <code>showStoryPart()</code> function updates the DOM dynamically and renders new choices. Endings reset with a “Restart Adventure” button. This object-based system made it easy to debug and expand.</p>

    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong>  
    Story path logic occasionally broke due to incorrect object keys or commas, but using <code>console.log()</code> helped fix logic quickly. Another challenge was organizing images consistently for each story branch.</p>

    <p><strong>Enhancements:</strong>  
    Added a flowchart page and hover transitions. The color palette matches the Pokémon theme. The project can be further improved with sound or animations in future versions.</p>

    <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong>  
    I learned how to manage branching logic with JavaScript objects, dynamically manipulate DOM elements, and improve debugging using browser tools. It taught me both creative storytelling and practical front-end logic.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
    This Pokémon adventure project fulfills the mid-term objectives by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web experience with 8 unique endings. It demonstrates interactivity, design, and problem-solving.</p>
