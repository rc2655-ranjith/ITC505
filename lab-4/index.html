    <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
    <p>
      For this project, I focused on creating a layout that enhances readability and visual balance 
      for essay-style content. I selected “Segoe UI” and “Arial” as the primary fonts because they 
      are clean, modern, and supported on most systems, which makes the text easy to read on 
      laptop screens. Headings were sized hierarchically—<code>h1</code> at 2.2em, <code>h2</code> at 
      1.6em, and <code>h3</code> at 1.3em—to establish clear structure and emphasize key sections. 
      The color scheme combines blue-gray tones (<code>#1d3557</code> and <code>#457b9d</code>) 
      with a light background (<code>#f8f9fa</code>), creating professional contrast while remaining 
      easy on the eyes. Margins (40px auto) and consistent padding (20px) add white space that prevents 
      text crowding and helps focus attention on content. I also used subtle link hover effects to 
      indicate interactivity without cluttering the layout.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Abuse Corrections</h3>
    <p>
      In my Lab 2 version, I used some heading levels based on visual appearance instead of document 
      hierarchy—for example, using an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the title. In this revision, I 
      corrected these issues by assigning the title as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and using 
      <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for sub-sections. Inline styles were 
      removed, and all presentation elements were moved to the CSS file to maintain clean, 
      semantic HTML that separates structure from style.
